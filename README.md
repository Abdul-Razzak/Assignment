# Assignment
There are two projects in the repository:

1. Web Service: Build it with dependencies and run the project.
2. Rest Client: Change the path variable to the directory location which needs to be scanned on the machine where the service is deployed.

Known issues: 
1. The frequency of repeated words is not filtering <tabs and spaces more than once>

Incomplete part: 
1. No unit testing and error handling is implemented.
